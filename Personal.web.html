                    <p>To begin I am a Computer Science major who attends Stonehill College. I'm Puerto Rican and grew up in Boston for my entire life. I've always been drawn to computer science so learning how to make websites is very interesting to me. </p>
                    <p>Some hobbies that I enjoy are as followed:</p>

                    <ol>

                        <li>TJX</li>
                        <p>For TJX I worked at a TJMax in Dedham where I did both retail and cashiering.</p>
                        <li>Local 11</li>
