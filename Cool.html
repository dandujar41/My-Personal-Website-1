                        <img class="Myself" src="Media/MyDogs.jpg" alt="These are my dogs" width="70%" />
                        <p>I love dogs I always wanted a dog when I was little and now I have 2 dogs. Both are shih tzu's one is named Gizmo the other is named Coco. They are polar oppisite personalities but they have grown to like each other.  </p>
                        <li>Wally</li>
                        <img class="Myself" src="Media/bird.avif" alt="This is the type of bird I have " width="70%" />
                        <p>I think its random but I do have a bird I don't know much on my bird but his name is Wally. He was a gift given to my dad by my Uncle and I think Wally is close to being around 30 so he's old.</p>

                <h2>Sports</h2>
                    <p>There are two sports I enjoy the most and that would be Baseball and Basketball</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Baseball</li>
                        <p>I have played baseball since I was 4 years old. My dad was the one who wanted me to play and I grew up to love the sport playing it all the way until the end of highchool. I ended up being the varsity team captain for my school and that was a cool experience. I would pick up the sport in the future maybe I'll end up doing what my dad did and Picking up softball in m later years.</p>
                        <li>Basketball</li>
                        <p>I used to play on a basketball team when I was younger however that is not the impact it left on me. Me dad was the one who got me interested in basketball and one of my favorite things to do with him is watch a celtics game and be able to spend some time with him doing that. Including basketball here is more of a shoutout to my dad.</p>

                <h2>Final Project</h2>
                    <p>Me and groupmates are thinking of creating a chat app. Within this app you will be able to make an accoun't and be able to communicate with other people as any other chat app works. You will also be able to tamper with the setting add a profile picture and delete your account within this app. I'm looking forward to this it sounds like fun</p>
